# Access Control Lists (ACL) Configuration — Cisco Packet Tracer Lab

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Access Control Lists (ACL)** in **Cisco Packet Tracer** to manage and secure network traffic across multiple routers.  
The configuration applies both **Standard** and **Extended ACLs** to control which hosts or networks can access specific destinations or services.

## 📘 Overview

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are a fundamental part of network security and traffic management.  
In this lab, ACLs are used to:
- Filter and control network traffic based on IP addresses, protocols, and ports  
- Restrict access between different subnets  
- Simulate real-world network policies using router configurations  

This setup helps visualize how ACLs affect data flow within a LAN or multi-router environment.

## 🧩 Network Topology

The topology consists of three routers and multiple end devices connected through switches.  
Each router is configured with routing and ACL rules to enforce access policies.  
A visual representation of the topology is included in the `/assets/` directory.
